# Chess.DB.WebAPI
A RESTful api for my Chess Game database

# Overview

I felt that I had gotten a little out of date and rusty with some of the core parts of getting an API setup with enterprise level functionality and features. 

Various additional MVC tooling (specifically around middleware, filters handling etc.) has got considerably cleaner release after release and many previous alternate approaches to typically, cross-functional requirements such as logging, authorisation, monitoring, have become baked in to .NET Core

So I decided to create a template RESTful API over a large database of(2M+ chess games) I have lying around. following some formal guides (I used a combination of MSDN and some pluralsight courses) to systematically go through the creation of a WebAPI from scratch and fill in any gaps I had in my knowledge of .NET Core/MVC applications.
